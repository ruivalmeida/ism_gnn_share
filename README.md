# Hello and Welcome

This repository was created for sharing a presentation and some
auxilliary files which I created for a PhD course on artificial
intelligence tools and methods, namely Graph Neural Networks. If you
googled your way here and are interested in this topic, knock yourself
out! If you came here on my suggestion, then probably you already know
all this and need no introduction. 


In any case, enjoy!
